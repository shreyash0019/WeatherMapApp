# Weather App

This is a simple weather application that provides the current weather for your location. The app uses the OpenWeather API and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for its implementation.

## Features

- Fetches and displays the current weather for your location.
- Provides information such as temperature, weather description, and humidity.
- Simple and clean user interface.

## How It Works

1. Click on the **Get Current Location Weather** button.
2. The app will request access to your location.
3. Upon granting permission, the app fetches the weather data for your location using the OpenWeather API and displays it.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the application.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For fetching and displaying weather data dynamically.

## Files

- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the app.

- `style.css`: Contains the styles for the app.

- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic for fetching and displaying weather data.

## API Key

The application uses the OpenWeather API to fetch weather data. Ensure that the `apiKey` variable in `script.js` is set to a valid OpenWeather API key.

## How to Run

1. Download or clone the repository.
